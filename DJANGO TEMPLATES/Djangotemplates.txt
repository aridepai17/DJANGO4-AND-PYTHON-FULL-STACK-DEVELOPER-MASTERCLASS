TEMPLATE DIRECTORIES 

-> Usually, however, we would like to know to separate out template folders based on their application rather than have a single template folder for the entire project.
-> Separating out template directories by app is more ideal because in the future you may want to reuse a Django app in a future project.
-> Having everything in its own app directory makes this reuse easy.
-> In order for the Django Project to be aware of the app's template directory existence, we do need to register the custom Django app in the settings.py under the INSTALLED_APPS variable.

-> Often you'll have multiple template files with the same name ( multiple index.html files, one for each app index view page ).
-> Because of the way Django searches for matching template names, to make sure we get the relevant template for the app, we create the app subdirectory underneath the template folder.

DJANGO FILTERS

-> Filters are built-in modifiers in Django templating that allow you to quickly apply a change to a variable on the template side, rather than in your Python script.
