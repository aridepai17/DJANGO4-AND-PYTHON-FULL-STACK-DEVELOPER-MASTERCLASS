STRINGS

-> Strings in Python are used to hold text information and are indicated with the use of single or double quotes.
-> We can also think of a string as a sequence of characters, this means there is an order to the string.

LISTS

-> Lists are a data structure in Python can hold elements in a sequence defined by brackets where each element is spaced out by a comma:
   ["item", 0, 10.3, "some", myvar ]
-> We can use them to organize data in a sequence ordering, meaning we can then grab individual elements from that list.

DICTIONARIES

-> Dictionaries allow us to store data in key-value pairs:
    -> { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2" }
-> Notice how keys aren't typically numbers, we use dictionaries when it makes more sense to organize data lookup by a key rather than position.
