DJANGO LINODE DEPLOYMENT

-> Lets explore how to deploy our Django application tothe web so anyone can visit our site!

KEY REQUIREMENTS

-> Anyone can visit our website online.
-> We don't want to concern ourselves about uptime or resiliency.
-> Need to support Python/Django.
-> Need to connect to cloud server.
-> Need to be able to push updates to our code and have version control.

Cloud Service Provider:
    -> Hosts a computer/server with our Django application.
    -> Many cloud service providers available.
    -> Often it is a trade-off between ease of use and price.
    -> A cloud provider with an nice balance between price and ease of use is Linode.
    -> We can use Linode to setup an online server that contains our Django Web Application.

Version Control:
    -> We want a way to edit our websites code and keep track of changes.
    -> For this we use system called git that keeps track of versions, and we use GitHub to store our code.
