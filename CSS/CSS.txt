CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

-> CSS is designed to separate out the styling of the HTML elements into a separate document.
-> HTML elements have a style attribute, for example -
    -> <p style="color:green">Text</p>
-> It's a lot more efficient to separate out these style property assignments to another CSS file and then link that CSS file to the HTML.
-> This also allows us to assign styles to multiple HTML elements at once using selectors.

-> We've seen that we can use divs and spans to apply styling to only certain elements, even if they share the same tag.
-> However, we can use selectors like class and id to have a lot more control and flexibility over this.
-> We can assign elements a cals attribute with a specific name for CSS purposes.
-> Classes are typically used within divs to group the styling of everything inside the div container together.
-> Classes can be repeatedly used across a webpage across elements.
-> IDs are an attribute also used to connect for styling, but should be completely unique and used for only a single elements on the webpage.

-> We've seen taht using CSS we can specify a border around an HTML element.
-> This border is actually part of the CSS Box Model which is group of edges surrounding the element.
