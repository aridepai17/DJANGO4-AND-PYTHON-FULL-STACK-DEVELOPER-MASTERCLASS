DJANGO CLASS BASED VIEWS

-> So far we've only seen functions indie our views.py file, but just like Forms and Models,
    Django provides an entire View class system that is very powerful for quickly rendering commonly used views.
-> Django CBV come with many pre-built class views fro common tasks, such as listing all the values for a particular
    model in database (ListView) or creating a new instance of a model object (CreateView).

-> There are a few operations that are very common with models: Create, Detail, Update, Delete, List.
-> Django provides CBVs that automatically create the appropriate views, forms, and context objects for predefined template names by simply begin connected to a model.
-> These classes require just a few attributes and automatically do the work for you!
